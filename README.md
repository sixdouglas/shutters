Shutters
====

**Shutters** is a NodeJS project that I've created to command my home shutters from the Web. It's a responsive web application based on Tweeter Bootstrap CSS Framework.

# shutters

## Usage

When used from a mobile, you can only send the command to raise or lower your shutters. When used from a laptop you can add, edit, remove shutters and modify the user information (name, email address, login and password).

## Developing

Actually all the job is done in the /routes/shutters.js function *renderAction*. Well it doesn't do anything but that is the place where you are supposed to call the external program to actually do the stuff.
